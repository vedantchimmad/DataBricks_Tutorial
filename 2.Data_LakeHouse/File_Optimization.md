# ‚ö° Data File Optimization Techniques in Databricks (Delta Lake)

Efficient data storage and processing are critical for performance and cost optimization in **Databricks Delta Lake**.  
Here are the key techniques to optimize Delta tables and files üöÄ

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Auto Optimize & Auto Compaction
- **Purpose:** Reduce small file problem and optimize writes.
- **How it works:** Automatically compacts small files during writes into larger files.
- **Configuration:**
```sql
-- Enable Auto Optimize on a table
ALTER TABLE sales_data SET TBLPROPERTIES (
  delta.autoOptimize.optimizeWrite = true,
  delta.autoOptimize.autoCompact = true
);
````

‚úÖ Best for streaming and frequent small batch writes.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ OPTIMIZE Command (Compaction)

* **Purpose:** Compact many small files into fewer large files.
* **Why:** Spark performs better when working with fewer large files instead of many small ones.
* **SQL Example:**

```sql
-- Compact files for better performance
OPTIMIZE sales_data;

-- Compact only a specific partition
OPTIMIZE sales_data WHERE region = 'APAC';
```

* **Result:** Improves query speed and reduces metadata overhead.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Z-Ordering (Data Skipping Optimization)

* **Purpose:** Co-locate related data in the same set of files for faster filtering.
* **How it works:** Reorganizes data files based on columns frequently used in filters or joins.
* **SQL Example:**

```sql
-- Optimize table with Z-Ordering on product_id
OPTIMIZE sales_data
ZORDER BY (product_id, region);
```

* **Use Case:** When queries often filter by certain columns (e.g., `customer_id`, `date`).

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Data Skipping Indexes

* **Purpose:** Delta Lake maintains min/max statistics for each column in a file.
* **Result:** Queries can skip reading irrelevant files.
* **How it works:** Automatic, no user configuration required.

‚úÖ Works best when combined with **OPTIMIZE + Z-Order**.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Partitioning

* **Purpose:** Organize data by partition columns to reduce scan.
* **Best Practices:**

    * Use **low cardinality** columns (`region`, `year`, `month`).
    * Avoid **high cardinality** columns (`customer_id`, `transaction_id`).
* **SQL Example:**

```sql
-- Create a partitioned table
CREATE TABLE sales_data (
  id STRING,
  amount DECIMAL(10,2),
  region STRING,
  year INT,
  month INT
)
USING DELTA
PARTITIONED BY (year, month);
```

‚úÖ Improves pruning but over-partitioning can cause too many small files.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Caching & Materialized Views

* **Caching**

```python
# Cache frequently used table
spark.sql("CACHE SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE year=2025")
```

* **Materialized View**

```sql
-- Create pre-computed view
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE sales_summary AS
SELECT region, SUM(amount) as total_sales
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region;
```

‚úÖ Useful for repeated analytics queries.

---

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ Data Layout & File Format Optimization

* Use **Delta (Parquet under the hood)** instead of CSV/JSON for efficient compression and column pruning.
* Configure **target file size**:

```sql
SET spark.databricks.delta.optimizeWrite.fileSizeMB = 256;
```

‚úÖ Ensures each file is large enough (\~256 MB) for efficient Spark processing.

---

## 8Ô∏è‚É£ Vacuum (File Cleanup)

* **Purpose:** Remove old/unreferenced files after retention period.
* **SQL Example:**

```sql
-- Remove old data files older than 7 days
VACUUM sales_data RETAIN 168 HOURS;
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Be careful: After vacuuming, older versions may not be queryable.
