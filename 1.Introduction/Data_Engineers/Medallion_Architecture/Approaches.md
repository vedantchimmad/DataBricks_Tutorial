# Approaches Used in Medallion Architecture

The **Medallion Architecture** (Bronze → Silver → Gold) can be implemented using different **approaches** depending on data requirements, latency needs, and use cases.  
Each approach defines **how data flows and is processed across the layers**.

---

## 🔹 1. Batch Processing Approach

📌 Data is ingested, transformed, and loaded at scheduled intervals.  

- **Bronze** → Raw files (daily/hourly loads).  
- **Silver** → Batch ETL for cleaning & transformations.  
- **Gold** → Aggregated reports for BI.  

✅ Best for: Historical analysis, periodic reporting, cost efficiency.

## 🔹 2. Streaming / Real-Time Approach

📌 Data is processed **as soon as it arrives** (near real-time pipelines).

* **Bronze** → Continuous ingestion from Kafka, EventHub, IoT, CDC.
* **Silver** → Streaming jobs clean & enrich data on the fly.
* **Gold** → Real-time KPIs, dashboards, fraud detection models.

✅ Best for: IoT data, fraud detection, user activity monitoring, stock trading.

Streaming Sources → (Real-time ingestion) → Bronze → (Structured Streaming) → Silver → (Real-time KPIs) → Gold
```

## 🔹 3. Hybrid (Batch + Streaming) Approach

📌 Combines both **batch** and **streaming** for flexibility.

* Streaming data flows into Bronze → Silver.
* Batch jobs periodically reconcile or enrich data.
* Gold layer contains both near real-time KPIs and batch summaries.

✅ Best for: Enterprise systems that need both real-time dashboards + batch reporting.

Streaming + Batch Sources → Bronze → Silver (clean & merge) → Gold (dashboards & reports)
```

## 🔹 4. CDC (Change Data Capture) Approach

📌 Data changes (insert/update/delete) are captured and processed.

* Bronze → Stores raw CDC logs (Debezium, Fivetran, ADF, DMS).
* Silver → Merges changes into up-to-date datasets.
* Gold → Curated slowly changing dimensions (SCD Type 1/2).

✅ Best for: Incremental updates, keeping data warehouse in sync with source systems.

Source DB → CDC Logs → Bronze (raw events) → Silver (merge) → Gold (business snapshots)
```

---

## 🔹 5. ELT (Extract → Load → Transform) Approach

📌 Data is first **loaded raw** into Bronze, then transformed downstream.

* Bronze → Store raw data "as-is".
* Silver → SQL-based transformations inside Lakehouse.
* Gold → Business metrics, ML-ready datasets.

✅ Best for: Cloud-native Lakehouse environments (Databricks, Snowflake).

Load Raw → Bronze → SQL Transformations → Silver → Aggregations → Gold
```

## 🔹 6. ETL (Extract → Transform → Load) Approach

📌 Data is transformed **before loading** into target tables.

* Ingest → Clean data before Bronze.
* Silver → Light transformations only.
* Gold → Curated layer.

✅ Best for: Traditional warehouses, when transformation needs happen before storage.

```text
Source → ETL Tools (ADF, Glue, Informatica) → Bronze/Silver → Gold
```

## 🔹 Summary

Different approaches to implement **Medallion Architecture**:

* 🕒 **Batch Processing** → Periodic jobs.
* ⚡ **Streaming** → Real-time pipelines.
* 🔄 **Hybrid** → Mix of batch + streaming.
* 📝 **CDC** → Capture incremental changes.
* 🏗️ **ELT** → Load raw → transform later.
* 🔧 **ETL** → Transform before loading.

✅ The choice depends on **latency, scalability, and business use cases**.
