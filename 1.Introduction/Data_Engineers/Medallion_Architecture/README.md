# Medallion Architecture in Databricks

**Medallion Architecture** is a **data design pattern** used in Databricks Lakehouse to organize data into **multiple layers** (Bronze, Silver, and Gold).  
It improves **data quality, reliability, and accessibility** while enabling scalable analytics and AI.

---

## 🔹 Key Idea

Instead of loading raw data directly into analytics systems, data is **incrementally refined** through layers:  
- **Bronze → Silver → Gold**  
- Each layer improves **data quality, structure, and usability**.

## 🔹 Layers of Medallion Architecture

| Layer | Icon | Description | Example Data |
|-------|------|-------------|--------------|
| **Bronze** | 🥉 | Raw data (ingested as-is) from source systems. Minimal transformations. | Logs, IoT streams, CDC events, raw JSON/CSV files |
| **Silver** | 🥈 | Cleansed, validated, and structured data. Business logic applied. | Clean customer records, standardized transactions |
| **Gold** | 🥇 | Curated, aggregated, and business-ready data for analytics & ML. | Sales KPIs, customer 360 views, churn prediction dataset |

      🥉 Bronze Layer - Raw Data (Delta Lake)
     • Raw ingestion
     • Schema-on-read
     • Immutable storage
                         │
                         ▼
      🥈 Silver Layer - Cleaned & Structured
     • Deduplication
     • Validation
     • Standardization
     • Schema enforcement
                         │
                         ▼
      🥇 Gold Layer - Curated & Aggregated
     • Aggregations
     • Business KPIs
     • Feature store datasets
                         │
                         ▼

## 🔹 Benefits of Medallion Architecture

| Benefit          | Explanation                                                    |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Quality** | Raw → cleaned → curated ensures trust in analytics.            |
| **Scalability**  | Layered approach supports batch & streaming data.              |
| **Reusability**  | Silver data can serve multiple Gold use cases.                 |
| **Governance**   | Easier to apply security & compliance at each layer.           |
| **Flexibility**  | Can handle structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data. |
| **ML Readiness** | Gold layer provides feature-rich datasets for ML pipelines.    |

## 🔹 Example in Databricks

```sql
-- Bronze Layer: Ingest raw JSON logs
CREATE TABLE bronze_events
USING DELTA
AS SELECT * FROM cloud_files('/raw/logs/', 'json');

-- Silver Layer: Clean & standardize
CREATE TABLE silver_events
USING DELTA
AS SELECT DISTINCT user_id, timestamp, action
FROM bronze_events
WHERE user_id IS NOT NULL;

-- Gold Layer: Aggregated KPIs
CREATE TABLE gold_user_activity
USING DELTA
AS SELECT user_id, COUNT(*) AS total_actions
FROM silver_events
GROUP BY user_id;
```

---

## 🔹 Summary

* **Medallion Architecture = Bronze → Silver → Gold**.
* **Bronze** → Raw ingestion.
* **Silver** → Cleaned & standardized.
* **Gold** → Curated for business/ML.
* Provides **trustworthy, scalable, and governed data** in the **Lakehouse**.

✅ This layered approach ensures data is **reliable, reusable, and analytics-ready**.
