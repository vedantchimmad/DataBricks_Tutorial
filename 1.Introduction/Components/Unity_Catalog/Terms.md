| **Catalog** | A top-level container inside a Metastore. Used to organize schemas, tables, and other objects. | `main`, `finance`, `marketing` |
| **Schema (Database)** | Logical grouping of tables, views, and functions within a catalog. Similar to a database in SQL. | `main.sales` |
| **Table** | Structured dataset governed by UC. Can be **Managed** (data stored by Databricks) or **External** (data stored in cloud storage). | `main.sales.revenue` |
| **View** | Virtual table built on top of tables or queries. Governed by UC security. | `CREATE VIEW ...` |
| **Function (UDF)** | User-Defined Function (SQL, Python, etc.) governed by UC. Can be shared securely. | `CREATE FUNCTION my_mask()` |

## üîê **Security & Access Control**

| Term | Explanation | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|

| **Row-Level Security** | Restrict access to rows in a table based on conditions. | Only see rows for `region = 'India'` |
| **Column-Level Security** | Restrict access to sensitive columns. | Hide SSN column from non-admins |
| **Masking Policy** | Policy applied to hide or obfuscate sensitive data values. | Masking SSN as `XXX-XX-1234` |
| **Row Filter Policy** | Restrict rows dynamically based on user identity. | Salesperson only sees their accounts |

## üìÇ **Data Location & Storage**

| Term | Explanation | Example |

| **Storage Credential** | Secure cloud access configuration (IAM role, Service Principal, etc.) that UC uses to access external locations. | `CREATE STORAGE CREDENTIAL s3_role` |
| **Managed Table** | Data stored and fully managed by Databricks. | `CREATE TABLE sales_data` |
| **External Table** | Data stored in external cloud storage, registered in UC but not physically stored in Databricks. | `CREATE TABLE sales_data LOCATION 's3://bucket/'` |

## üîé **Governance Features**

| Term | Explanation | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Data Lineage** | Tracks the full lifecycle of data (input ‚Üí transformation ‚Üí output ‚Üí dashboards). Shown visually in Databricks UI. | View where `revenue` table data came from |
| **Audit Logs** | Track who accessed data, when, and how. Useful for compliance (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2). | `SELECT * FROM system.access.audit_logs` |
| **Data Sharing (Delta Sharing)** | Securely share data with external users, orgs, or platforms without copying data. | Share sales data with a partner |

| **Feature Store** | Managed repository for ML features, governed by UC. | `SELECT * FROM main.ml.features.customer_age` |
| **ML Models in UC** | MLflow models stored and governed within Unity Catalog. | `main.ml_models.churn_model` |
